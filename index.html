      Android phones aren't nearly as bad as you think.
    </h1>

    <p>
      With over 1 billion iPhone users worldwide, 
      it's not surprising to see the
      amount of Apple users bullying android users.
      "Shut up before I take your
      batteries out" is a phrase I've heard for far too long.
      Pages and pages of
      android memes flood my Instagram feed, 
      as well as my Twitter. Apple users
      would say things like "androids suck",
      "trash camera quality that", "the
      headphone jack is at the top of the phone" 
      and much more. Personally, I am
      S I N C E R E L Y fed up with it. 
      Apple may have an intuitive UI and a
      sleek, futuristic design, but that 
      doesn't mean that it's a good phone.
      Take for example, Apple's iPhone XR, 
      compared to the Samsung Galaxy S10e
      which are both $750 
      (at the time of me writing this, August 2019).

      <li>Developer options and special optimizations</li>
      <li>All available without jailbreaking your phone</li>

    <h2>Amazing cameras!</h2>

   <p>
     This one's pretty self-explanatory.

        <li>Different price points and uses for each phone</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>It's just my preference!</h2>
    <p>
      It's just what I grew up with, and I want to share it with people.
